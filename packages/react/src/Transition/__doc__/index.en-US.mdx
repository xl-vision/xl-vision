# Transition

The basic transition animation component, through which the transition state of the `React` component can be flexibly controlled.

> **NOTE**

> When using this component, be sure to call the last callback function in `appear`, `enter`, `leave`, and `disappear` in time to indicate the end of the animation, otherwise the animation will be blocked in an intermediate state.

:::demo ./Basic.tsx

Basic

By passing in hook functions such as `beforeEnter`, `enter`, `afterEnter`, `enterCancelled`, `beforeLeave`, `leave`, `afterLeave`, and `leaveCancelled` to trigger the corresponding animation. Trigger the entry and exit hooks by changing the attribute `show`.

:::

:::demo ./Appear.tsx

Automatically trigger entry and exit animations

Setting `transitionOnFirst` will automatically trigger the in and out animation. If `in=true`, the hooks of `beforeAppear`, `apper`, `afterAppear`, and `appearCancelled` will be triggered. If not set, the hooks of `beforeEnter`, `enter`, `afterEnter`, and `enterCancelled` will be used.

If `in=false`, the hooks of `beforeDisappear`, `disapper`, `afterDisappear`, and `disappearCancelled` will be triggered. If not set, the hooks of `beforeLeave`, `leave`, `afteLeave`, and `leaveCancelled` will be used.
