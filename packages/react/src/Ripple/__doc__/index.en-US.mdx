# Ripple

It is very convenient to realize the ripple animation effect when clicked.

## Demos

:::demo ./Basic

Basic

Put `Ripple` in the container where you want to use the ripple effect. With a certain style, you can easily achieve the ripple animation effect when clicked.

:::

:::demo ./Advance

Force the entrance animation to end and then trigger the exit animation

By setting `leaveAfterEnter`, you can wait until the end of the entering animation before triggering the exit animation.

It is used when we need to fully display the approach animation, such as the complete ripple effect in `Button`, even if we quickly click and cancel.

You can quickly click and compare with the above example to see how the animation changes.
