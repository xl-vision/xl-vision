Basic usage

Basic usage

:::

:::demo ./Offset

Offset

Control the spacing between the popper and the reference by setting `offset`.

:::

:::demo ./Shift

Keep the popup in the visible area

By offsetting the popper position to a certain extent, it is guaranteed that it is always within the visible area. When the references all leave the viewport, the popper follows. That is to say, the popper is kept in the viewable area with priority.

:::

:::demo ./AutoPlacement

Automatically calculate location

When the visible space in the specified direction is insufficient, the direction with sufficient space will be automatically selected for display

:::

:::demo ./Hide

Hide

The popper is automatically hidden when the reference goes beyond the visible area.

:::

:::demo ./VirtualElement

Virtual element

You can also target virtual elements, such as the right mouse button.

:::

:::demo ./AutoUpdate

Automatically update positioning

Automatically monitor events such as scrolling or other strategies to ensure accurate positioning
